   <p>A tiny chickadee sitting on a small pile of snow, but to him it would be a hill of snow. Its camouflage is pretty bad, it really stand out.</p>

      <img class="zoom" src="Game 1.png" alt="CastleVania" style="width:100%">
      <h3>CastleVania Symphony of the Night</h3>
      <p>One of the coolest pieces of cover art for a game... in reality it's the cover art from a game collection that looks vastly better than the original art.  </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="column VidArt">
    <div class="content">
      <img class="zoom" src="Game 2.png" alt="Bloodstained" style="width:100%">
      <h3>Bloodstained Ritual of the Night</h3>
      <p>A cool game I got for $15 in 2019 and fell in love with. It's just like CastleVania but it came out 20 years later or something. </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="column VidArt">

      <img class="zoom" src="Game 3.jpg" alt="Sonic" style="width:100%">
      <h3>Sonic Mania</h3>
      <p>A pretty cool piece of cover art for a game, but the only way you'd ever see it was if you took it out of the box and turned it inside out. </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="column VidArt">
    <div class="content">
      <img class="zoom" src="Game 4.jpg" alt="Souls" style="width:100%">
      <h3>Demon's Souls</h3>
      <p> A game that revolutionized the game industry, but it didn't sell as well as the "sequel" Dark Souls so everyone gives the credit to that one instead. What a shame, the atmosphere and artstyle of this game was fantastic, and the music was very unique and understated.  </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="column VidArt">
    <div class="content">
      <img class="zoom" src="Game 5.jpg" alt="Mega" style="width:100%">
      <h3>Mega Man</h3>
      <p>One of the most infamously bad pieces of game cover art. I'm surprised that this game sold at all considering people had to see it and decide "yeah I want to play this."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="column VidArt">

      <img class="zoom" src="Game 6.png" alt="Pizza" style="width:100%">
      <h3>Pizza Tower</h3>
      <p> A game that I eagarly wait for about 5 years to play. It's very polished and incredibly well animated, it looks like a 90's cartoon. </p>
    </div>
  </div>

      <img class="zoom" src="Game 7.jpg" alt="MGS" style="width:100%">
      <h3>Metal Gear Solid 3</h3>
      <p> A great game that takes place in a fake rainforest in Russia during the cold war. I have no idea what they were thinking with this one it's odd</p>

  <div class="column VidArt">
    <div class="content">
      <img class="zoom" src="Game 8.jpg" alt="Resi" style="width:100%">
      <h3>Resident Evil Remake HD Remaster</h3>
      <p> One of the best horror games ever made, even if it is just a remake of the original playstation version. They just don't make them like this anymore. </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="column VidArt">
    <div class="content">
      <img class="zoom" src="Game 9.png" alt="Katamari" style="width:100%">
      <h3>Katamari Damacy</h3>
      <p> An odd game about rolling up everyday objects and people into a ball and launching them into space. This one has great music as well, I'd recommend Gin and Tonic as its nice and jazzy. </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="column VidArt">
    <div class="content">
      <img class="zoom" src="Game 10.jpg" alt="Metroid" style="width:100%">
      <h3>Super Metroid</h3>
      <p> The best videogame ever made (in my opinion). It was great music, revolutionary gameplay, a nice story told without dialogue, and cool aliens. Videogame developers have tried to replicate this game's perfect design, and none have succeeded. </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="column VidArt">
    <div class="content">
      <img class="zoom" src="Game 11.jpg" alt="Okami" style="width:100%">
      <h3>Okami</h3>
      <p> This is a game I never had the chance to play, and it's a shame since the game really looks like a Japanese caligraphy painting but in 3d. Too  bad I was grounded when it came out.  </p>
    </div>

  <div class="column VidArt">
    <div class="content">
      <img class="zoom" src="Game 12.jpg" alt="Mario" style="width:100%">
      <h3>Super Mario Bros. 3</h3>
      <p> This is my favorite Super Mario game ever. It has a great difficulty curve and really fun levels and powerups. It even had a neat 80's cartoon, the boxart is VERY bright and yellow. It stands out garishly among a shelf of other Nintendo games. </p>

      <h3>Jaws</h3>
      <p>A movie I've never seen. I was supposed to watch it one night and fell asleep instead. It definitely has a shark in it. </p>

<div class="column Movi">

    <img class="zoom" src="Movie 2.jpg" alt="Movi" style="width:100%">
    <h3>The Thing (1982)</h3>
    <p>One of the best horror movies I've ever seen. It's pretty brutal so it's not for everyone. </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="column Movi">
 <div class="content">
  <img class="zoom" src="movie 3.jpg" alt="Movi" style="width:100%">
  <h3>Casablanca</h3>
  <p>An interesting movie that I watched this summer. A nice little love story with good music. I first learned about this movie because of a World History course in High School, and then I shoved it into the back of my mind until summer. </p>
 </div>
</div>

<div class="column Movi">
 <div class="content">
  <img class="zoom" src="movie 4.jpg" alt="Movi" style="width:100%">
  <h3>The Batman</h3>
  <p> This is my favorite (and in my opinion best) Batman film. It has great music out of all of them, great actors that play great interpretations of the characters, and it follows an intriguing storyline that I never get bored of. The movie is visually spectacular as well. I'm so excited for the sequel, but I may have to wait a couple years for it.  </p>

<div class="column Movi">
 <div class="content">
  <img class="zoom" src="movie 5.jpg" alt="Movi" style="width:100%">
  <h3>9</h3>

 <div class="content">
  <img class="zoom" src="movie 6.jpg" alt="Movi" style="width:100%">
  <h3>Citizen Kane</h3>
  <p> Another iteresting movie that I watched this summer. Maybe not the best film of all time, but an insanely good one that holds up well. </p>

 <div class="content">
  <img class="zoom" src="movie 7.jpg" alt="Movi" style="width:100%">
  <h3>Star Wars</h3>
  <p> A cultural revolution, this movie changed EVERYTHING. This was one of the most influential pieces of media ever created and spawned stories in all mediums, like books, music, video games, and statues/sculptures. The unfortunate thing about it is that you can't legally watch the original 1977 version, just the new tampered versions. </p>

  <img class="zoom" src="movie 8.jpg" alt="Movi" style="width:100%">
  <h3>GoodFellas</h3>
  <p> This is a great ganster/mafia film. This is considered to be one of the best films of all time by many people, especially critics. While it is entertaining, I don't entirely agree with that statement. I enjoy Casino slightly more despite not being as iconic.  </p>

  <img class="zoom" src="movie 10.jpg" alt="Movi" style="width:100%">
  <h3>2001 a Space Odyssey</h3>
  <p>This film still holds up and deserves the praise it gets. It looks so good it is used as evidence to support moon landing conspiracy theories.  </p>

 <div class="content">
  <img class="zoom" src="movie 11.jpg" alt="Movi" style="width:100%">
  <h3>My Neighbor Totoro</h3>

  <h3>Home Alone</h3>
  <p>A movie that I watched recently (about two weeks ago if you're reading this after November 24th) with my father and younger brother. It was a very good time, it was quite funny and had felt quite unique, even though I've seen Home Alone 2 before. </p>

      <h3>Girl with a Pearl Earring</h3>
      <p>The title didn't lie. This really is a girl with a pearl earring. She is making the same expression as an employee when you ask them what isle you can find a specific item at a store.</p>

      <h3>Portrait of Helen Klimt</h3>
      <p>Another portrait of someone I have no idea or context for, I did some surface level research in this "Helen Klimt" person and didn't find anything. She has a good haircut though. </p>

      <h3>Blue Horse I</h3>
      <p>I feel like there may be something deeper to this painting, I'm not sure why someone would paint a horse (which is difficult) and then make it blue. Weird. </p>

      <h3>Saint Francis of Assisi in His Tomb</h3>
      <p>I thought that this painting looked visually striking, it instantly caught my attention and I couldn't help but throw it in. The shading and cloth folds look so good, I wish I could paint like this!</p>

      <h3>Mona Lisa</h3>
      <p>I don't have any context for this painting. It is famous, just because? No answer or explanation has ever satisfied me personally.</p>
